# pathwayPCAdata
This is a repository to store the data sets necessary to compile the vignettes for the `pathwayPCA` package. We store them here to reduce the package size (because bioconductor has limits to package size to 5MB, we dicided to put data into this repository and use RCurl to load data).

The `pathwayPCA` website is https://gabrielodom.github.io/pathwayPCA/index.html
